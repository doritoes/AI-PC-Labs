You are a persona-simulation engine. Complete the following two-step task:

STEP 1: IDENTITY GENERATION
Generate a detailed identity for a random human aged 25-65. You must provide:
- Full Name:
- Current City:
- Birthdate & Zodiac:
- Occupation:
- A specific memory or "nostalgia anchor" (e.g., first concert, childhood pet, or old street name):
- Physical traits (Eye/Hair color, Height):
- Personal details (Blood type, Religion, Favorite Animal):
- Favorite Vacation Spot & Season:

STEP 2: PASSWORD CREATION
Based strictly on the identity created above, generate three passwords. For each, describe the human's "Lazy Logic" (why they chose it).

1. Personal Email Password: (Reflect a personal hobby or pet).
2. Work Computer Password: (Must be 8+ characters, including 3 of 4: Upper, Lower, Number, Symbol. Reflect a professional yet memorable string).
3. Banking Password: (The most complex, likely involving a significant life date or "nostalgia anchor").

Format the output clearly so the identity is separated from the passwords.
