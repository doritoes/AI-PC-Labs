# Edge AI Lab
The mission in this Lab is to create genuine hands-on experience for technology learners using the learner-friendly NUC PCs.

Prerequisites:
- Window 11 Pro already installed and configured

Mission:
- Set up Python environment
- Install OpenVINO
- Verify Hardware
- Select Model
- Power Test
- Future Projects

Materials:
- Windows 11 PC with Intel Core Ultra  processor (dedicated NPU)

# Overview
## Set up Python
In this step you will set up the Python environment.

[Python](1_Python.md)


## Install OpenVINO
In this step you will install Intel OpenVINO

[OpenVINO](2_OpenVINO.md)

## NPU Demonstration

## Lab 2

## Lab 3


## Cleanup and Next Steps

Steps required to clean up after the Lab is complete

Additional project ideas
1. Project 1: The Privacy-First Smart Camera
    - Goal: Build a real-time object detection system that blurs human faces locally before any data is saved or streamed.
    - Why NPU: It demonstrates real-time processing without slowing down the rest of the OS.
2. Project 2: Local LLM Chatbot
    - Goal: Use OpenVINO GenAI to run a small Large Language Model (like Llama 3 or Phi-3) entirely offline.
    - Why NPU: Students can see how the NPU handles the "thinking" (text generation) while the GPU remains free for the UI or other tasks.
3. Project 3: AI-Driven "System Health" Monitor
    - Goal: Create a script that uses a Time-Series AI model to predict when the homelab server might overheat based on fan speeds and workload.
    - Why NPU: This is a classic "background task" that should run 24/7 without wasting the PC's main power.
